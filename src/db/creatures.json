For the gray mass quobbed and quivered, and swelled perpetually; and from it, in manifold fission, were spawned the anatomies that crept away on every side through the grotto. There were things like bodiless legs or arms that flailed in the slime, or heads that rolled, or floundering bellies with fishes' fins; and all manner of things malformed and monstrous, that grew in size as they departed from the neighborhood of Abhoth. And those that swam not swiftly ashore when they fell into the pool from Abhoth, were devoured by mouths that gaped in the parent bulk.",

Each year thereafter, strange ripples reportedly disturbed the otherwise placid lake. On the one-thousandth anniversary of Ib's destruction, Bokrug rose up and utterly destroyed the city of Sarnath, so completely that not even ruins remained.
