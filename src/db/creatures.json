Their blood has been described as a 'foetid green ichor' or a 'green sticky stuff'. Interestingly, they are capable of going into suspended animation until softened and reheated by the sun or some other source of heat.",

    "overview": "The zoogs are a race of sentient forest-dwelling creatures that inhabit the Dreamlands of Earth. They are mortal enemies of cats, as they prey upon kittens and are preyed upon in return by adult cats. The aspect of a zoog calls to mind that of a tentacled-whiskered rodent with a grizzled or dun-colored fur. Its great eyes bestow upon it a most disquieting and peculiar gaze.",
